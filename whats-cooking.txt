What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2025, #08; Tue, 28)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* jc/show-usage-help (2025-01-17) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-01-21 at 5a17181a32)
 + builtin: send usage() help text to standard output
 + oddballs: send usage() help text to standard output
 + builtins: send usage_with_options() help text to standard output
 + usage: add show_usage_if_asked()
 + parse-options: add show_usage_with_options_if_asked()
 + t0012: optionally check that "-h" output goes to stdout

 The help text from "git $cmd -h" appear on the standard output for
 some $cmd and the standard error for others.  The built-in commands
 have been fixed to show them on the standard output consistently.

 Make sure that "git --attr-source=X", GIT_ATTR_SOURCE, and

* ps/3.0-remote-deprecation (2025-01-24) 6 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-01-28 at 970fcdf59d)
 + remote: announce removal of "branches/" and "remotes/"
 + builtin/pack-redundant: remove subcommand with breaking changes
 + ci: repurpose "linux-gcc" job for deprecations
 + ci: merge linux-gcc-default into linux-gcc
 + Makefile: wire up build option for deprecated features
 + Merge branch 'ps/build' into ps/3.0-remote-deprecation

 Following the procedure we established to introduce breaking
 changes for Git 3.0, allow an early opt-in for removing support of
 $GIT_DIR/branches/ and $GIT_DIR/remotes/ directories to configure
 remotes.

 Will merge to 'master'.

* cc/lop-remote (2025-01-27) 6 commits
 - doc: add technical design doc for large object promisors
 - promisor-remote: check advertised name or URL
 - Add 'promisor-remote' capability to protocol v2
 - version: make redact_non_printables() non-static
 - version: refactor redact_non_printables()
 - version: replace manual ASCII checks with isprint() for clarity

 Needs review.

* ds/backfill (2025-01-23) 6 commits
 - backfill: assume --sparse when sparse-checkout is enabled
 - backfill: add --sparse option
 - backfill: add --min-batch-size=<n> option
 - backfill: basic functionality and tests
 - backfill: add builtin boilerplate
 - Merge branch 'ds/path-walk-1' into ds/backfill
 (this branch uses ds/path-walk-1.)

 Lazy-loading missing files in a blobless clone on demand is costly
 as it tends to be one-blob-at-a-time.  "git backfill" is introduced
 to help bulk-download necessary files beforehand.

 Expecting a reroll.

* ps/send-pack-unhide-error-in-atomic-push (2024-11-14) 2 commits
 - transport: don't ignore git-receive-pack(1) exit code on atomic push
 - t5504: modernize test by moving heredocs into test bodies

 "git push --atomic --porcelain" used to ignore failures from the
 other side, losing the error status from the child process, which
 has been corrected.

 On hold.
 Needs to see if competing parallel topic needs to replace this one.

* ds/name-hash-tweaks (2025-01-27) 7 commits
 - pack-objects: prevent name hash version change
 - test-tool: add helper for name-hash values

 - pack-objects: add GIT_TEST_NAME_HASH_VERSION

 "git pack-objects" and its wrapper "git repack" learned an option
 to use an alternative path-hash function to improve delta-base
 selection to produce a packfile with deeper history than window
 size.

 . repository: BUG when is_bare_cfg is not initialized

 . git: remove is_bare_repository_cfg global variable

 Code rewrite to turn the is_bare_repository_cfg global variable
 into a member in the the_repo singleton repository object.

 Has been in "Waiting for response to reviews" state for too long.
