What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2024, #09; Thu, 26)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Let's wait for gitk and possibly po/ and delay the tagging of the
-rc1.  Many people are already offline for the end-of-year holidays
and it is a slow week, and 'master' front has too many new things
graduated from 'next' a bit too early for me to feel comfortable.

Extra testing the tip of 'master' before we actually tag it is as
always very much appreciated.  Right now, the optional meson-based
build does not pass gitweb tests, IIUC.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 The custom allocator code in the reftable library did not handle
 failing realloc() very well, which has been addressed.

 Needs review.

* ps/3.0-remote-deprecation (2024-12-12) 6 commits
 - remote: announce removal of "branches/" and "remotes/"
 - builtin/pack-redundant: remove subcommand with breaking changes

 $GIT_DIR/branches/ and $GIT_DIR/remotes/ directories to configure
 remotes.

 Needs review.

* ds/backfill (2024-12-20) 6 commits
 - backfill: assume --sparse when sparse-checkout is enabled
 - backfill: add --sparse option
 - backfill: add --min-batch-size=<n> option
 - backfill: basic functionality and tests
 - backfill: add builtin boilerplate
 - Merge branch 'ds/path-walk-1' into ds/backfill
 (this branch uses ds/path-walk-1.)

 Lazy-loading missing files in a blobless clone on demand is costly
 as it tends to be one-blob-at-a-time.  "git backfill" is introduced
 to help bulk-download necessary files beforehand.

* ps/send-pack-unhide-error-in-atomic-push (2024-11-14) 2 commits
 - transport: don't ignore git-receive-pack(1) exit code on atomic push
 - t5504: modernize test by moving heredocs into test bodies

 "git push --atomic --porcelain" used to ignore failures from the
 other side, losing the error status from the child process, which
 has been corrected.

 Needs to see if competing parallel topic needs to replace this one.

 - pack-objects: create new name-hash function version

 "git pack-objects" and its wrapper "git repack" learned an option
 to use an alternative path-hash function to improve delta-base
 selection to produce a packfile with deeper history than window
 size.
