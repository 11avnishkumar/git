What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2024, #07; Thu, 19)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

An early preview release Git 2.48-rc0 has been tagged.  The rate of
arrival of new topics unfortunately exceeds the rate of reviews and
iterations, which means that many topics are left out of 'next',
waiting to be reviewed.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/

* bf/fetch-set-head-config (2024-12-06) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-12-11 at 900cadd7b7)
 + remote set-head: set followRemoteHEAD to "warn" if "always"
 + fetch set_head: add warn-if-not-$branch option
 + fetch set_head: move warn advice into advise_if_enabled
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-12-04 at 69bfc59fb5)
 + fetch: add configuration for set_head behaviour
 + Merge branch 'bf/set-head-symref' into bf/fetch-set-head-config
 (this branch uses bf/set-head-symref.)

 "git fetch" honors "remote.<remote>.followRemoteHEAD" settings to
 tweak the remote-tracking HEAD in "refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD".

 Will merge to 'master' after bf/set-head-symref and its fix-up.

* bf/set-head-symref (2024-11-25) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-12-02 at b142ff3d8e)
 + fetch set_head: handle mirrored bare repositories
 + fetch: set remote/HEAD if it does not exist
 + refs: add create_only option to refs_update_symref_extended
 + refs: add TRANSACTION_CREATE_EXISTS error
 + remote set-head: better output for --auto
 + remote set-head: refactor for readability
 + refs: atomically record overwritten ref in update_symref
 + refs: standardize output of refs_read_symbolic_ref
 + t/t5505-remote: test failure of set-head
 + t/t5505-remote: set default branch to main
 (this branch is used by bf/fetch-set-head-config and jc/set-head-symref-fix.)

 When "git fetch $remote" notices that refs/remotes/$remote/HEAD is
 missing and discovers what branch the other side points with its
 HEAD, refs/remotes/$remote/HEAD is updated to point to it.

 Will merge to 'master' together with jc/set-head-symref-fix.

* jc/set-head-symref-fix (2024-12-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2024-12-13 at 478444359e)
 + fetch: do not ask for HEAD unnecessarily
 + Merge branch 'bf/set-head-symref' into js/set-head-symref-fix
 (this branch uses bf/set-head-symref.)

 "git fetch" from a configured remote learned to update a missing
 remote-tracking HEAD but it asked the remote about their HEAD even
 when it did not need to, which has been corrected.  Incidentally,
 this also corrects "git fetch --tags $URL" which was broken by the
 new feature in an unspecified way.
