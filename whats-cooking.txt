What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2025, #01; Tue, 4)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

* ds/backfill (2025-02-03) 7 commits
 - backfill: assume --sparse when sparse-checkout is enabled
 - backfill: add --sparse option
 - backfill: add --min-batch-size=<n> option
 - backfill: basic functionality and tests
 - backfill: add builtin boilerplate
 - Merge branch 'master' into ds/backfill
 - Merge branch 'ds/path-walk-1' into ds/backfill

 Lazy-loading missing files in a blobless clone on demand is costly
 as it tends to be one-blob-at-a-time.  "git backfill" is introduced
 to help bulk-download necessary files beforehand.

 Will merge to 'next'?

* ps/send-pack-unhide-error-in-atomic-push (2025-02-03) 8 commits
 - send-pack: gracefully close the connection for atomic push

 "git push --atomic --porcelain" used to ignore failures from the
 other side, losing the error status from the child process, which
 has been corrected.

* ds/name-hash-tweaks (2025-01-27) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-02-04 at d83bc700a7)

 "git pack-objects" and its wrapper "git repack" learned an option
 to use an alternative path-hash function to improve delta-base
 selection to produce a packfile with deeper history than window
 size.

 Will merge to 'master'.
